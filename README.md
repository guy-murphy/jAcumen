###jAcumen is a ToipcMap CMS for Java/JRuby/Rails

This project started life as a CMS called Acumen written on the .NET platform with it's own MVC Web application framework and distributed file system. This is a port and a clean-up of that system performed as a proof of concept.

This project is now being ported back to .NET and the beginning stages of that can be seen at [guy-murphy/Conclave](https://github.com/guy-murphy/Conclave).

For presentation jAcumen serialises the current 'view state' model to XML and then uses XSL for rendering.

Development of this project is no longer active having served its purpose, but it might be resurected at some point in the future.
