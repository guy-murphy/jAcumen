###jAcumen is a ToipcMap CMS for Java/JRuby/Rails

This project started life as a CMS called Acumen written on the .NET platform with it's own MVC Web application framework and distributed file system. This is a port and a clean-up of that system performed as a proof of concept.

This project is now being ported back to .NET and the beginning stages of that can be seen at [guy-murphy/Conclave](https://github.com/guy-murphy/Conclave).
